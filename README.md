# hello-world
This is my first repository that I make as a 18yo UGent student
So I today I had my first exam and it was a bit hard and I didn't finish.
During the exam I did regret a bit about not studying some parts that could've helped me to earn some points.
But let's fingers cross and hope that I'll succeed

Today I have my fourth exam of the second semester. ouuuuf
